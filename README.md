# openeo-sentinel-reference-jobs

Reference jobs that use the reference data specified in <https://github.com/Sijoma/openeo-sentinel-referencedata>

## Results

The results are to large to be uploaded to github. In the future, I may create a dataset that contains the results and the process graphs in one.

One may send the process graphs to the back-ends with <http://editor.openeo.org/>.

## Changelog

6. April: First jobs working for EURAC and GEE (Swiss and Netherlands region)
7. April: Island and Venezuela working, new structure
